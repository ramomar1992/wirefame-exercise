# wirefame-exercise
This repository was created to do the wireframe exercise assigned by *code fellows* in **lab08a** of **class-201**

The lab asked to create an HTML page that adds some placeholder paragraphs and images to the wireframe. This lab aims to allow us to exercise how wireframes are made in simple and easy way.
